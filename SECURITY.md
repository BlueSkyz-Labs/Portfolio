# Security Policy

## Supported versions

Security fixes apply to the latest `main` deployment of this portfolio.
Historical preview deployments are not independently supported.

## Content Security Policy

Static assets ship a strict CSP via `public/_headers` (Workers Static Assets):

- `default-src 'self'`
- `script-src 'self'` (no third-party scripts)
- `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'` — required for Astro/Tailwind inline critical CSS in the static HTML output
- no `'unsafe-eval'` and no wildcard origins

Widen a directive only when an approved source is introduced, and document the exact reason here.
